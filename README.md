# Search Engine

A search engine built using Java, file parsing, inverse index, tree data structures, and additional features such as a GUI, HTML parsing, and web crawling. The search engine allows users to input a query and find the most relevant pages from a set of documents stored in a database.


## Technologies

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for building the search engine.
- **File Parsing**: Used to extract data from documents in various formats.
- **Inverse Index**: A data structure that maps terms (words) to their occurrences in documents, providing efficient search capabilities.
- **Tree Data Structure**: Organizes and stores data in a hierarchical manner.
- **GUI**: Graphical User Interface for easier interaction with the search engine.
- **HTML Parsing (Jsoup Library)**: Parses HTML files for data extraction and indexing.
- **Web Crawling**: Automated crawling of websites for gathering documents to index.

## Features

- **User Query Input**: Allows users to input a query and retrieve relevant documents.
- **Efficient Search**: Uses an inverse index to quickly search for documents containing the query terms.
- **GUI**: User-friendly graphical interface for interaction.
- **HTML Parsing**: Parses HTML files to extract the content and index it for search.
- **Web Crawling**: Automatically crawls websites to index relevant pages.
- **Relevant Results**: Ranks and displays the most relevant results based on query terms.
- **Scalable**: Easily adaptable to handle larger datasets and more documents.
